<h1>Pre-Processing Algorithms</h1>


<h2>Important Terminologies</h2>

  * **Modeling** : The mathematical construction and computer implementation of an object, by defining points in a 3D array.
  * **Surface**: A compact, connected, orientable 2D or 3D manifold, possibly with boundary.
  * **Mesh**: A collection of triangular (or quadrilateral) contiguous, non-overlapping faces joined together along their edges.

<h2>Technologies Used </h2>

  * **PCL** : The Point Cloud Library (**PCL**) is a standalone, large scale, open project for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing. It implements a set of algorithms designed to help work with 3-D data, in particular point clouds.<br>
    Following classes of PCL were implemented: **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis), **MLS** (Moving Least Squares)
