<h1> Drone 3D Topography </h1>

<h2> Summary </h2>

* The idea is to have a Drone fly over some terrain in ROS with a GPS and a Depth sensor, then get the pointcloud data from the drone and create a 3D map of the topography of the terrain. 
* The main aim of the project is to learn about surface reconstruction of pointcloud data involving techniques such as subsampling and various algorithm for mesh creation.
