# LINEAR ALGEBRA
* In linear algebra when thinking of a vector always first think of an arrow present in the X-Y coordinate system with its tip of the tail is fixed at the origin.
* The coordinates of the vector then can be considered as the list of numbers.

* any vector can also be represented by sum of scaling of unit vectors of the three coordinate axes
  eg. suppose a vector has coordinates (x,y,z) then can be written as 
  xi+yj+zk
  This is also known as __basis__ of the vectors
* linear combination of two vectors is by considering those two vectors as the fixed vectors which are then scaled and added to get new vectors.

* think of individual vectors as arrows and multiple vectors as points
* Transformations is nothing but a function which takes in one vector and gives an output vector
* linear transformation for an infinite grid has two properties:

    1) all lines must remain straight
    2) the origin must not shift
* for linear transformation of any vector we must always track where does i and j goes

  here __a__ and __c__ are the coordinates where i lands and __b__ and __d__ are the coordinates where j lands in the new transformed grid.
