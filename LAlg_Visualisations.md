### Chapter 02: Linear Combinations, Span & Basis Vectors

In the XY-coordinate systems, there are two very special vectors:
<!-- Blockquote -->
<!--UL -->
> * The one pointing to the right with length 1, commonly called “i-hat” or the unit vector in the x-direction.
> * The one pointing straight up with length 1, commonly called “j-hat” or the unit vector in the y-direction.
